# Cost-Analysis-of-Hydrogen-Production
- The costs of hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) and electrolysis of water were analyzed.
- The Python code performs thermodynamic calculations to estimate reactant conversion and energy requirements, and generate plots for SMR.
- An equilibrium reactor for SMR has been simulated using DW-SIM.
